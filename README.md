# Gradient_Descent_Method
Hand calculation and python implementation of Stochastic and Batch Gradient Descent Method


# This notebook gives you a basic understanding of Stochastic Gradient Descent and Batch Gradient Descet. 
# I have implemented using hand calculation and python scikit learn. 
# I have used only 5 samples with 1 independent predcictor to get the solid understanding of gradient descent process.
